#DontFallForit
Predicting workplace falls based on personal characteristics.

The raw data file I used is from the CDC BRFSS Survey. I haven't included it or the cleaned data file because they are too big for GitHub.

The Jupyter notebooks go through my cleaning of the data and my attempts at modeling the data using machine learning.
